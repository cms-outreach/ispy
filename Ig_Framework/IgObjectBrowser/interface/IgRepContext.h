/** A multi-way association to link a representable object and a rep in a
    particular model.

  #IgRepSet for a #IgRepresentable consists of circular list of these
  context objects, one for each distinct #IgModel in which the
  representable object is represented.  This object is the multi-way
  association linking #IgRep, #IgModel and #IgRepSet together.
  Through the #IgRepSet link the original application object is also
  accessible.

  The client must create a rep and a context exactly as follows to
  guarantee that the rep and context are properly registered in the
  #IgRepSet of the application object:
    - it must first create the rep
    - it must then create a new context; it can either pass the rep
      set or the object (in which case a rep set is looked up or
      created as required), and it must also pass the rep and the
      model

  If the #IgRepresentable or the #IgRepSet are destroyed, all their
  #IgRepContext objects are also destroyed.  This will cause the
  #IgRep to be destroyed as well.  If the #IgRep is destroyed for any
  other reason, it must take care to destroy its context object as
  well.  The exact patterns in which these must be done are described
  in #IgRep documentation.

  Note that it is not permissible to create a rep that inherits both
  #IgRep and #IgRepContext.  (FIXME: Killed by non-virtual destructor
  which is invoked by the #IgRepSet -- need to arrange for more
  flexible erasure patterns.)  */
