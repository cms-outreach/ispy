This package provides the infrastructure for object browsers.  See the
documentation for the description of the concepts and for the details;
you can start following the documentation trail in `Browser.h'.

`ObjectBrowser' provides only the browsing infrastructure, it does not
provide any browsers itself.  However, you can look into the `test'
subdirectory to see an example of how a couple of trivial browser
could be implemented and used.  Instructions for creating new browser
types and for describing application objects for browsers are included
in the documentation trail.

If you have questions on this package, have problems with it, or have
found a bug, please raise the issue on the developers mailing list
(atlas-sw-developers@atlas-lb.cern.ch).  The author's contact address
is listed in the `PACKAGE' file.
