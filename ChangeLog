	  Includes fix for "last dot" from George.

Script to indent sources added to repository.

* Requires Lassi's defaults and emacs.

Fixes all the known indentation and spacing issues.

* 2 spaces rather than 4 for indentation.
* No tabs.
* No space between method name and "(...)".

Remove gl2ps and associated code.

Cleans up Iguana/Inventor shapes.

* Unused shapes (and tests) removed from Iguana/Inventor.
* Used shapes (and tests) moved to Iguana/QtGUI/src (or test).
* Workaround to get the patch working with old release
  areas.

MDI Widget removed.

The following patch fixes a few warnings, in particular:

* Removes (or uses properly) unused parameters.
* Fixes a warning about signed / unsigned conversions.
* Removes useless assert for unsigned int > 0.
* Fixes ambiguous if - else if statement.

Misc fixes (Lassi & Giulio).

* Uses /afs/cern.ch/cms/CAF/CMSCOMM/COMM_DQM/ispy-files as shortcut in the dialog.
* Uses a working url as default for the Open Url dialog.
* Removes "," after please.
* Transparency is now back to "sorted object blend".
* Resilient handling of archives with both geometry and events.

New web wizard and ability to fetch stuff from the web (Giulio).

* On startup, if no files are provided, a new wizard pops up, allowing you,   
  among other things, to download files from the web.
* The new startup wizard also provides a "Latest News" dialog and a slighly
  reworked "About" dialog. The "Latest News" dialog fetches news from:

    http://iguana.web.cern.ch/iguana/ispy/ispy-news.htm

* An "Open url" dialog (accessible from the "File" menu) is provided to 
  download ig files by specifying a url. 

Improved event drawing logic to highlight interesting parts. (Lucas)

* General tuning of all drawstyles to be able to see key physics features
  without the need to turn off all low energy / high multiplicity objects 
  first.
* Fix tracker/pixel hits, digis and rec hits colors and shapes
    * same base colour per detector
    * higher multiplicity objects (e.g. digis) dimmer
    * pixels hotter than strips
* Draws the HCAL energy not as towers but as boxes centred on
  Calorimeter cell and scaled by energy but not to exceed tower size.
* Create IgDrawTowerHelpers on stack (to avoid memory leaks).
* New missing Et drawing with energy label.

Reworked drawing logic by Lassi.

* All the twigs are now gone, drawing logic moved completely to
  ISpyApplication.
* Multi-threaded read logic is now gone.
* About dialog now behaves correctly.
* Geometry and envets can now be part of the same file.
* Multiple files can be read and iSpy behaves as expected.
* Collection table now updates correctly.

Improved API for IgCollection, IgCollectionIterator, IgDataStorage, ParseError

* Operators ++, --, -= += for IgCollectionIterator properly implemented. 
* Arrow (->) operator added for IgCollectionIterator.
* IgCollection::hasProperty(const std::string &) added.
* IgDataStorage::getCollectionPtr / IgDataStorage::getAssociationSet
  now can retrieve properties using an std::string or the position 
  of the collection / association set in the data storage.
* ParseError now can return the  position where the error occurred.

Improved overlay display.

* Better formatting / control of formatting
* Multi-line (primitive table) for event info
* perspective -> orthographic camera to avoid strange behaviour when resizing  
  window
