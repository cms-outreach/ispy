Improved event drawing logic to highlight interesting parts. (Lucas)

* General tuning of all drawstyles to be able to see key physics features
  without the need to turn off all low energy / high multiplicity objects 
  first.
* Fix tracker/pixel hits, digis and rec hits colors and shapes
    * same base colour per detector
    * higher multiplicity objects (e.g. digis) dimmer
    * pixels hotter than strips
* Draws the HCAL energy not as towers but as boxes centred on
  Calorimeter cell and scaled by energy but not to exceed tower size.
* Create IgDrawTowerHelpers on stack (to avoid memory leaks).
* New missing Et drawing with energy label.

Reworked drawing logic by Lassi.

* All the twigs are now gone, drawing logic moved completely to
  ISpyApplication.
* Multi-threaded read logic is now gone.
* About dialog now behaves correctly.
* Geometry and envets can now be part of the same file.
* Multiple files can be read and iSpy behaves as expected.
* Collection table now updates correctly.

Improved API for IgCollection, IgCollectionIterator, IgDataStorage, ParseError

* Operators ++, --, -= += for IgCollectionIterator properly implemented. 
* Arrow (->) operator added for IgCollectionIterator.
* IgCollection::hasProperty(const std::string &) added.
* IgDataStorage::getCollectionPtr / IgDataStorage::getAssociationSet
  now can retrieve properties using an std::string or the position 
  of the collection / association set in the data storage.
* ParseError now can return the  position where the error occurred.

Improved overlay display.

* Better formatting / control of formatting
* Multi-line (primitive table) for event info
* perspective -> orthographic camera to avoid strange behaviour when resizing  
  window
