	* ISpy3DView.h, ISpyApplication.h, Ig3DBaseModel.h,
	  ISpy3DView.cc, ISpyApplication.cc, Ig3DBaseModel.cc:
	  support for view with separate cameras. There is now
	  an additional method "camera" to specify the initial
	  (default) camera all the subsequently defined views share.


	* ISpyApplication.cc, ISpyApplication.h,
	  ui_IgMainWindow.h, IgMainWindowMDI.1.0.ui: multiple view
	  support added. There is now a "view" specification method, 
	  which can be used to assign all the subsequent "collection"
	  specification to a given view.

	* ISpyApplication.cc: support for GSF tracks and L1 triggers.

2009-07-14  Thomas McCauley <mccauley@mail.cern.ch>
	
	* ISpyApplication.cc: renaming / regrouping of collections.

2009-07-10  Thomas McCauley <mccauley@mail.cern.ch>

	* ISpyApplication.cc: Fixes spurious SimHits.

2009-07-09  Giulio Eulisse <giulio.eulisse@cern.ch>

	* ISpyApplication.cc, ISpyApplication.h,
	  ui_IgMainWindow.h, IgMainWindowMDI.1.0.ui: better look 
	  and feel for the tree viewer.
	  Besides prettier colors and fonts, it now resizes correctly,
	  with the number of items and the checkbox remaining anchored
	  to the right side.

	* ISpyApplication.cc: better grouping of collections.

2009-07-07  Giulio Eulisse <giulio.eulisse@cern.ch>

	* ISpyApplication.h, ISpyMainWindow.h, ispy.qrc, ui_IgMainWindow.h:
	  reverting erroneous commit by Ianna.

2009-07-03  Giulio Eulisse <giulio.eulisse@cern.ch>

	* ISpyApplication.cc, ISpyApplication.h: support from two level
	  grouping structure in the tree view. It is now possible to
	  specify a two level structure by simply passing "Group/Name" to
	  the "collection" method. Group state (expanded or collapsed) is
	  preserved across event / file boundaries. Collection specification
	  without a two level grouping will be added by default to the
	  "Others" group.

2009-07-02  Giulio Eulisse <giulio.eulisse@cern.ch>

	* ISpyApplication.cc: more fixes in the tree view. In particular
	  elements are now sorted according the order in which `collection`s
	  specifications are created. 

2009-07-02  Giulio Eulisse <giulio.eulisse@cern.ch>

	* ISpyApplication.cc: Fix the about dialog not appearing correctly.

2009-07-02  Thomas McCauley <mccauley@mail.cern.ch>

	* ISpyApplication.cc: updated default settings for visibility.

2009-06-29  Giulio Eulisse <giulio.eulisse@cern.ch>
	
	* ISpyApplication.cc: Misc cosmetic fixes.

	    * Documentation for the visibility option added. 
	    * NULL changed to 0 everywhere.

	* ISpyApplication.cc: reindentation fixes.

2009-06-29  Giulio Eulisse <giulio.eulisse@cern.ch>

	* ISpyApplication.h, ISpyApplication.cc: Improved visibility handling.
	  
	  * Removes dependency on QSettings.
	  * Adds an option to specify the default visibility for each
	    collection spec.
	  * Does not show the checkbox in the case the collection is not to be
	    drawn in 3D.  

2009-06-29  Thomas McCauley <mccauley@mail.cern.ch>

	* IgSoSplineTrack.cc, ISpyApplication.cc: SimTracks support.
	  Includes fix for "last dot" from George.

Script to indent sources added to repository.

* Requires Lassi's defaults and emacs.

Fixes all the known indentation and spacing issues.

* 2 spaces rather than 4 for indentation.
* No tabs.
* No space between method name and "(...)".

Remove gl2ps and associated code.

Cleans up Iguana/Inventor shapes.

* Unused shapes (and tests) removed from Iguana/Inventor.
* Used shapes (and tests) moved to Iguana/QtGUI/src (or test).
* Workaround to get the patch working with old release
  areas.

MDI Widget removed.

The following patch fixes a few warnings, in particular:

* Removes (or uses properly) unused parameters.
* Fixes a warning about signed / unsigned conversions.
* Removes useless assert for unsigned int > 0.
* Fixes ambiguous if - else if statement.

Misc fixes (Lassi & Giulio).

* Uses /afs/cern.ch/cms/CAF/CMSCOMM/COMM_DQM/ispy-files as shortcut in the dialog.
* Uses a working url as default for the Open Url dialog.
* Removes "," after please.
* Transparency is now back to "sorted object blend".
* Resilient handling of archives with both geometry and events.

New web wizard and ability to fetch stuff from the web (Giulio).

* On startup, if no files are provided, a new wizard pops up, allowing you,   
  among other things, to download files from the web.
* The new startup wizard also provides a "Latest News" dialog and a slighly
  reworked "About" dialog. The "Latest News" dialog fetches news from:

    http://iguana.web.cern.ch/iguana/ispy/ispy-news.htm

* An "Open url" dialog (accessible from the "File" menu) is provided to 
  download ig files by specifying a url. 

Improved event drawing logic to highlight interesting parts. (Lucas)

* General tuning of all drawstyles to be able to see key physics features
  without the need to turn off all low energy / high multiplicity objects 
  first.
* Fix tracker/pixel hits, digis and rec hits colors and shapes
    * same base colour per detector
    * higher multiplicity objects (e.g. digis) dimmer
    * pixels hotter than strips
* Draws the HCAL energy not as towers but as boxes centred on
  Calorimeter cell and scaled by energy but not to exceed tower size.
* Create IgDrawTowerHelpers on stack (to avoid memory leaks).
* New missing Et drawing with energy label.

Reworked drawing logic by Lassi.

* All the twigs are now gone, drawing logic moved completely to
  ISpyApplication.
* Multi-threaded read logic is now gone.
* About dialog now behaves correctly.
* Geometry and envets can now be part of the same file.
* Multiple files can be read and iSpy behaves as expected.
* Collection table now updates correctly.

Improved API for IgCollection, IgCollectionIterator, IgDataStorage, ParseError

* Operators ++, --, -= += for IgCollectionIterator properly implemented. 
* Arrow (->) operator added for IgCollectionIterator.
* IgCollection::hasProperty(const std::string &) added.
* IgDataStorage::getCollectionPtr / IgDataStorage::getAssociationSet
  now can retrieve properties using an std::string or the position 
  of the collection / association set in the data storage.
* ParseError now can return the  position where the error occurred.

Improved overlay display.

* Better formatting / control of formatting
* Multi-line (primitive table) for event info
* perspective -> orthographic camera to avoid strange behaviour when resizing  
  window
