	      file twice. Remove Twig options menu. Invalidation of Twigs removed - not
	      needed - the Twigs have just been created. Remove not needed header files.

 <h3>Changes in IGUANA 4.6.0</h3>
 <div class="sect1"><ul>
  <li> Release in CMS_84_1 CMS configuration with TGS Inventor 3.1.1 and
       patched SoQT 1.0.2 to avoid constant re-rendering issue with TGS Inventor.

       <br><br>
  <li> The highlights of this release are new configuration, new render model
       based on invalidation, improved 2D view, and several improvements to the 2D
       and 3D views: the objects in the scene are no longer prematurely clipped when
       zooming on the view, interiors of the objects become visible when clips or
       slicers are used, and slicers are symmetrically around centre positions (rather
       than one at the slicer edge as previously).  The IGUANA plug-in categories
       were also renamed (no client code changes required) to avoid conflicts with
       other projects such as SEAL.

       <br><br>
       <i><b>Important note:</b></i> The new invalidation-based rendering does
       require changes in client code.  We have updated all the code we have had
       access to.  In short, "doRepresent" should no longer be implemented for
       any twig type; one should implement "doUpdate" for all the models (text,
       3D, optionally 2D) of interest.  Any existing "doRepresent" implementations
       should be replaced with "doUpdate".</p>

	 <li> <i>IgOpenInventor:</i> New 2D/boolean operation implementation
	      based on BSP trees; GTS is no longer used.  New colour map and
	      colour conversion utilities.  Volume visualisation tools (the
	      field map plane) moved here as generic utilities -- one should
	      now be able to use the magnetic field visualisation with any
	      field, in experiment-independent manner.

	 when autoclippingis on.  Fixed axis button alignments icons.  Turn on double-sided
	 lighting when clips and slicers are used.  Move slicer planes at thickness/2
	 from centre rather than positioning on the edge of one of the planes.

 </ul></div>

 <h3>Changes in IGUANA 4.1.1</h3>
 <div class="sect1"><ul>
  <li> Release in CMS_61.

       <br><br>
  <li> The highlights of this release configuration update to support 
       multiple compilers on Linux: gcc 2.95 and gcc 3.2. 
       Port to Geant 4.5.

       <br><br>
  <li> <i>Ig_Modules/IgGeant4:</i> Current state updated, IgG4VisSceneHandler 
       updated.
 </ul></div>

 </ul></div>

 <h3>Changes in IGUANA 3.2.1</h3>
 <div class="sect1"><ul>
  <li> Release in CMS_55 for ORCA 6.3.x, otherwise identical to 3.2.0.
 </ul></div>

 <h3>Changes in IGUANA 3.2.0</h3>
 <div class="sect1"><ul>
  <li> Release in CMS_47 for ORCA 5.x and OSCAR 1.x.  Verified to work on
       CMS CERN platforms (GCC 2.95.x on RH 6.x, Sun CC 5.3 on Solaris 7
       and Solaris 8), plus the coming CMS Linux platform (GCC 3.2 on RH
       7.x).  It should also build directly with MSVC++ 7 on Windows but
       this has not been verified.

       <br><br>
  <li> The highlights of this release are completely reworked web pages,
       a G4 demo visualisation program, full HEP detector geometry as a
       another demo program, complete overhaul in the plug-in manager to
       make it much more flexible, introduction of proper internal state
       encapsulation, experimental high-quality (vector) postcript output
       for 3D scene prints, many improvements in the G4 visualisation,
       and tested compatibility with a build that makes use of only
       open-source code (using Coin3D as OpenInventor).  The specific
       changes are listed below.  (Nearly all the packages were touched
       due to the plug-in manager changes, introduction of the state and
       for changes for GCC 3.2 and for MSVC++ on Windows.  Most of these
       changes are trivial and not mentioned above.)
       
       <br><br>
  <li> <i>Ig_Applications/Iguana:</i> Fixes to avoid memory leaks.
  <li> <i>Ig_Documentation/IgDoxygen:</i> Completely new web pages.

       <br><br>
  <li> <i>Ig_Examples/IgG4Demo:</i> New standalone demo of writing a G4
       visualisation program using IgGeant4, mirroring Geant4 ExN02.
  <li> <i>Ig_Examples/IgHelloDriver:</i> New demo of a minimal driver.
  <li> <i>Ig_Examples/IgVisEx:</i>
       Creation of a full HEP detector geometry for a standalone
       IGUANA example/demonstration.  In order not to be totally
       trivial, it roughly describes the CMS detector.  It is,
       however completely self-contained and easy to follow.  No
       external data sources or CMS-specific code are required.

       <br><br>
  <li> <i>Ig_Extensions/IgOpenInventor:</i> IgLegoPlot made a shape.
       More tests.
  <li> <i>Ig_Extensions/IgQt:</i> Thumb wheel split off from SoQt.
       XPM files cleaned from "const" warnings.

       <br><br>
  <li> <i>Ig_Framework/IgPluginManager:</i> Rewritten for much more
       flexibility.  There can now be arbitrary categories of info
       items that can be handled lazily.  No longer uses XML.
  <li> <i>Ig_Framework/IgObjectBrowser:</i> Plug-in handling and
       program state management rewritten.
  <li> <i>Ig_Framework/IgApplication:</i> Fix off by one error in
       argument vector handling.  Better compiler recognition.

       <br><br>
  <li> <i>Ig_Imports/CSL-XML:</i> No longer released.
  <li> <i>Ig_Imports/classlib:</i> Better logging and minor bug fixes
       for multi-methods.
  <li> <i>Ig_Imports/gl2ps:</i> New package for capturing high-quality
       vector postcript output from OpenGL draw primitives.

       <br><br>
  <li> <i>Ig_Infrastructure/IgBuildScripts:</i> MSC++ project files.
  <li> <i>Ig_Infrastructure/IgNominy:</i> Automatically capture full
       configuration including compiler specifics from SCRAM.  Read
       cross-project logs from the projects themselves.  Add an option
       to reduce clutter in diagrams by reducing direct edges if an
       edge already exists indirectly.  Minor speed optimisations.

       <br><br>
  <li> <i>Ig_Modules/Ig3DBrowser:</i> Add experimental support for
       vector postscript output.
  <li> <i>Ig_Modules/Ig3DView:</i> New package for experimental work on
       document-centric studio views, in this case the 3D views.
  <li> <i>Ig_Modules/IgCommonData:</i> Twigs now support hinted changes.
  <li> <i>Ig_Modules/IgGeant4:</i> Cleanups and code simplifications.
       Better volume rendering, including hinted twig changes.
  <li> <i>Ig_Modules/IgQtBrowser:</i> Finished status bar handler.
  <li> <i>Ig_Modules/IgQtTextBrowser:</i> Correct selection response.
  <li> <i>Ig_Modules/IgQtTwigBrowser:</i> More debug logging.  Provide
       and respect twig change hints.
  <li> <i>Ig_Modules/IgStudio:</i> Experimental support for document
       centric visualisation model.  Minor user-interface tweaks.
  <li> <i>Ig_Modules/IgTextModel:</i> Correct notifications.
  <li> <i>Ig_Modules/IgVis:</i> Correct camera flip.  Corrected initial
       clip plane position.  One info stream can now capture all output.
       Improved twig status saving.  White lights.  Warning cleanups.
 </ul></div>

 <h3>Changes in IGUANA 3.1.1</h3>
 <div class="sect1"><ul>
  <li> Release in CMS_47 for ORCA 5.x and OSCAR.
       Verified with FNAL/D0 environment (KCC on RH7.x, KCC on IRIX 6.5 and
       MSVC++ 7 on Windows 2K) plus initially for GCC 3.1 on RH 7.x, though
       not all the configuration quirks have been fully smoothed out.  Much
       improved Geant4 visualisation.
       <br><br>
  
  <li> <i>config</i>: Better support for KCC/Linux, KCC/IRIX and GCC 3.1 on
       RH 7.x Linux.  Most of release build procedure is now in the project
       makefile as scram build targets.  Hacks to configure properly for the
       TeXlive installation when building manuals.
  <li> <i>Ig_Documentation/IgDoxygen:</i> Rewritten build notes.  Now
       substitutes a project version number in addition to the CVS tag
       when generating HTML pages.
  <li> <i>Ig_Infrastructure/IgBuildScripts:</i> <tt>make-release</tt>
       simplified, as most of the stuff is now a scram build target.
  <li> <i>Ig_Infrastructure/IgCxxFeatures:</i> GCC 3.1 compliance.
  
       <br><br>
  <li> <i>Ig_Framework/IgPluginManager:</i> Avoid unloading plugins
       when global destructor handling is incorrect (KCC Linux/IRIX).
       GCC 3.1 compliance.
  <li> <i>Ig_Framework/IgObjectBrowser:</i> GCC 3.1 compliance.
  
       <br><br>
  <li> <i>Ig_Modules/Ig3DModel:</i> Cosmetic convenience improvements (and
       adjusted for in <i>Ig3DBrowser</i> and <i>IgSoReaderAppDriver</i>).
  <li> <i>Ig_Modules/Ig3DBrowser:</i> Clip-planes and z-slicers now apply per
       object and have an entry in the object context menu.  New options for
       line smoothing and anti-aliasing in 3D view menu.  Fixed printing bugs.
  <li> <i>Ig_Modules/Ig3DExtensions:</i> Register IgSoG4Tubs.
  <li> <i>Ig_Modules/IgGeant4:</i> Substantial rewrite.  Many improvements
       that significantly enhance performance and reduce memory consumption.
       Magnetic field can now be shown as a slicer in the space.  Geant4
       trajectories have an initial representation.  Detector volumes can
       now have their colour and transparency changed via the context menu.
       Cleaned up internal implementation and some more class documentation.
       Trap drawing bug fixed.  Disabled skipping of physical mother volumes,
       it seems to cause problems during trajectory visualisation (thought
       to be a Geant4 tracking navigation bug).
  <li> <i>Ig_Modules/IgTextModel:</i> Rep text can now be changed.
  <li> <i>Ig_Modules/IgTreeModel:</i> GCC 3.1 compliance.
  
       <br><br>
  <li> <i>Ig_Modules/IgVis:</i> More extensive save/restore across sessions:
       window location, size, minimization; viewpoints created plus the last
       camera position.  [This appears to cause some problems on some platforms
       (menus may not render correctly when geometry has been restored).  Changing
       font size or "sweeping" through the menu will make them reappear; cause of
       this currently under investigation.]  OIV shape optimisation now available
       in the menu (risky for some shapes on some platforms; being investigated).
       Fixed noise character bugs in the info window.  New global scale control.
       2D twig layers are now automatically resized.  Better status bar messages.
  <li> <i>Ig_Examples/IgVisEx:</i> Handles missing dummy events file.  Initial
       code (not yet visible in the interface) for a demo experiment instead of
       a collection of shapes.  Use some internal optimised shapes in 2D part.
  
       <br><br>
  <li> <i>Ig_Extensions/IgOpenInventor:</i> GCC 3.1 compliance.  More doxygen
       documentation.  Correct normals for IgSoCrystalHit.  New classes
       IgSoCalHitKit (two-colour calorimeter hit) and IgSoPgon (GEANT3 shape).
  
       <br><br>
  <li> <i>Ig_Imports/CSL-XML:</i> GCC 3.1 compliance.
  <li> <i>Ig_Imports/SoQt:</i> Added libtool configuration for KCC/IRIX.
  <li> <i>Ig_Imports/classlib:</i> Porting fixes IRIX, Windows and GCC 3.1.

       IgQtMDIBaseShell.  Added option for producing a cut-away view
       and/or wireframe view of static elements (IgQtMDIBaseShell)
  <li> All Ig_Modules now keep their plug-in definitions in the src
       directory to avoid cross-project confusion.
 </ul></div>
  
 <h3>Changes in IGUANA 2.6.1 (developers only release)</h3>
 <div class="sect1"><ul>
  <li> 2.6.0 re-released against fixed configuration;
 </ul></div>
  
 <h3>Changes in IGUANA 2.6.0 (developers only release)</h3>
 <div class="sect1"><ul>
  <li> Migrated to Qt 3.0.1 -- no substantial code changes;
  <li> CMS_41 configuraton;
  <li> SCRAM 0_19_2.
 </ul></div>
  
 <h3>Changes in IGUANA 2.5.3 (developers only release)</h3>
 <div class="sect1"><ul>
  <li> No code changes;
  <li> CMS_39 configuraton;
  <li> SCRAM 0_19_2.
 </ul></div>
  
 <h3>Changes in IGUANA 2.5.2 (developers only release)</h3>
 <div class="sect1"><ul>
  <li> New classes added to IgOpenInventor for spline trackes, lego plot,
  vector postscript, particle database;
  <li> CMS_38 configuraton;
  <li> SCRAM 0_19_2.
 </ul></div>
  
 <h3>Changes in IGUANA 2.5.1 (developers only release)</h3>
 <div class="sect1"><ul>
  <li> Port to Anaphe 3.6.5;
  <li> Port to SCRAM 0_19_1.
 </ul></div>
  
 <h3>Changes in IGUANA 2.5.0 (developers only release)</h3>
 <div class="sect1"><ul>
  <li> Ig_Imports/classlib: Migrated to autoconf 2.5x.  Unified system error
       definitions across all platforms.  Multi-method macros simplified.
       Much improvement bit twiddling support.
  <li> IGUANA application code was factored into Ig_Framework/IgApplication.
       Ig_Applications/Iguana changed correspondingly.  IgApplication also
       adds classes to permit other packages to hook into the crash recovery
       services.  More such application-level services will be implemented
       in IgApplication in future.
  <li> Ig_Documentation/IgDoxygen: Considerable clean-up and minor updates
       of the makeDoc.prl script (a bit more flexible now, minor changes of
       doxygen configuration, now really removes the mydoc directory at the
       end).  Minor documentation fixes.
  <li> Ig_Utilities migrated to Ig_Infrastructure.
       Ig_Utilities/IgConfiguration's Architecture.h became system.h in
       Ig_Infrastructure/IgCxxFeatures (but remains to be unified with the
       automatically generated config.h in that package).
  <li> Ig_Extensions/IgGeant3: Decoupled from twigs.  You now need to set
       the Inventor node context explicitly.
  <li> Ig_Extensions/IgOpenInventor: Arrow direction bug fixed in
       IgSoArrow.  Tracks should now have correct direction arrows.
  <li> Ig_Extensions/IgQt: Several obsolete classes removed.
  <li> Ig_Modules/IgVis: Scene printing keeps background colour again.
  <li> Great renaming, documentation and general clean-up patch for the
       new architecture (Ig_Framework, Ig_Modules).  General shuffle to get
       things into the state for the new architecture release: IgBus was
       replaced by message-specific services, IgBrowserMethods was made a
       service, there is no longer a global IgSession object, multi-method
       macros were simplified, and plug-in database naming conventions were
       unified.
  <li> Initial port to Qt 3.0.0.  SoQt still not compatible but the rest
       of the code should now work with the new Qt.
 </ul></div>
  
  
 <h3>IGUANA 2.4.6 (developers only release)</h3>
 <div class="sect1"><ul>
  <li> IgCmscan has been replaced by IgVis. The new features that have been
       available from IgCmscan have been integrated into IgVis: tooltips, help in a
       netscape browser, what's this information, axis (visual feedback) set on by
       default. 
  <li> HEPVis (IGUANA branch of it) is now obsolete.  A new package
       IgOpenInventor now includes the extended OpenInventor nodes that used to
       be in HEPVis.  The script to update HEPVis from the FNAL repository has
       also been removed. (This change reflected also in IgGeant3 and IgGeant4.)
  <li> The test programs for IgOpenInventor nodes have been provided. The test 
       programs are build during the release and can be run (after setting the SCRAM 
       runtime environment) from the release area.
  <li> Short description of IgOpenInventor nodes.
  <li> IgQtTwigBrowser bug fix: fix incorrect usage of pixmaps.
  <li> SoQt bug fix: caused a crash of the 3D browser when clicked on X button.
  <li> Duplicate source files for AdvListView were removed from IgQt.
  <li> Ig_Examples domain documentation updated.
  <li> IgNominy configuration updated to recognise IgOpenInventor too.
  <li> Updated configuration to build IgOpenInventor and rename a makefile and a tag 
       to build qgl from libQGL to libqgl.
 </ul></div>
  
  
 <h3>Changes in IGUANA 2.4.5 (bug fix release: developers only release)</h3>
 <div class="sect1">Identical to IGUANA 2.4.4 with the following bug fixes:
 <ul>
  <li> SoResetTransformation nodes have been added back to the IgGeant3 nodes. (the nodes
       were removed in 2.4.4 to produce IV files for the new SoReader);
  <li> an SoSimpleTrajectory can contain one marker point - previously required
       two that was a reason of a crash while calculating a bounding box; 
  <li> a bugfix for the classlib that couldn't handle more then two browsers.
 </ul></div>
  
 <h3>Changes in IGUANA 2.4.4 (developers only release)</h3>
 <div class="sect1">An update of 2.4.3, built for both Linux and
 Solaris.  Changes from the previous release:
 <ul>
  <li> The iguana application can now preload shared libraries.

  <li> IgGeant3: Now resets coordinate system before adding new nodes.
       Fixes problems with certain scene graphs.

  <li> IgGeant4, IgG4XDummies: New packages for Geant4 visualisation.
       The former is a core package (still under development) for
       generic Geant4 visualisation.  The latter dummies out the
       unused Motif symbols needed by Geant4 libraries.

  <li> Ig3DModel, Ig3DBrowser: Optimise and simplify representations.
       Allows out-of-order representation creation.  Copy most of the
       IgCmscan functionality (clip planes, lights, render area
       decorations, axis buttons, background colours, printing).
       Initialisation reworked so that the browser is a SoQt widget.

  <li> IgCommonData: Rewritten as several layered classes; simplified.

  <li> IgQtTwigBrowser: Model removed, now uses the browser directly
       (due to Qt list design).  Builds representations lazily.  Adds
       a new column for separate control for the twig and its children.

  <li> IgSoReaderAppDriver: Reflects twig and 3D browser changes.
       Also recognises magic items like lights and clip planes.

  <li> Cosmetic changes to IgCmscan (help system; initial support
       for editing colour scales), IgQt (shut up compiler warnings),
       IgObjectBrowser (to handle object and representation deletions
       properly), classlib (minor state fix to multimethod updates),
       IgQtBrowser (add tear-off support for all menus), IgTextModel
       (handle representation deletion), IgVis (remove unnecessary
       consts to keep the solaris compiler happy), IgNominy.

  <li> IgVisEx: New example program to demonstrate the IgVis (IgCmscan
       rewrite) package.
 </ul></div>
  
 <h3>Changes in IGUANA 2.4.3 (developers only release)</h3>
 <div class="sect1">Building on 2.4.2, introduces the new framework to
 be used as a baseline for working with the ORCA and OSCAR
 visualisation.  Built both on Linux and Solaris, but the latter is
 somewhat broken.  Includes more specifically:

 <ul>
    <li> A new version of classlib: many improvements especially to
	 fatal error handling plus rewritten access to various kinds
	 of information about the process, host, and the user.
    <li> Support for plug-ins built into the program.
    <li> Introduces the session object and gets rid of the model and
	 representation plug-ins.  The session object now encapsulates
	 the global run environment, including command line arguments
	 and the plug-in database.  A session is now passed as an
	 argument to extensions and drivers.  The session also supports
	 auto-loading extensions by name prefix (to be extended to handle
	 wildcarding), and remapping extensions by name.  Rep mappers
	 are now simply extensions with a particular naming convention,
	 searched using a "global" session (the session constructed
	 first, usually done by the generic <tt>iguana</tt> program).
    <li> IgQtBrowser has now several services useful for Qt
	 applications. Some will be split into a Qt-specific and general
	 service, more and more complete services will come later.  It
	 now has enough to get us going.
    <li> SoReader now has a little more capabilities.  Still gets many
	 old .iv files wrong.  To be worked on in a future version.
	 Future versions will also get more comprehensive menus.
    <li> New IgVis module, George's extended work on IgCmscan.  IgCmscan
	 still left for backwards compatibility.
    <li> Rewritten TGSInventorFix.  Now includes only the stubs on both
	 platforms.
    <li> qgl (instead of QGL) now used everywhere.  Still having a problem
	 with Qt on Solaris including qgl, as opposed to the Linux build
	 which does not.  To be resolved.
    <li> Based on a new version of SCRAM (V0_19_0), mainly for C
	 compiler support.
  
    <li> Still to be done before a public release:
	 <ul>
	   <li> Check that TGSInventorFix works for in other projects.
	   <li> Make sure old SoQt pixmaps and splash screen code have
		been moved elsewhere.
	   <li> IgQt has AdvListView twice.
	   <li> Fold in IgNominy changes.
	   <li> Register the service extensions in IgQtBrowser.
	   <li> Migrate the kernel to CMS coding conventions.
	   <li> Update screen shots/document gallery.
	   <li> Add lots more documentation.
	 </ul>
 </ul></div>
  
 <h3>Changes in IGUANA 2.4.2 (developers release)</h3>

 IGUANA_*_*_*.</div>
  
 <h3>Changes in IGUANA V2_4_1 (developers release)</h3>

  <li> SoQt update - now it's build automatically from their sources
       imported into IGUANA;

       library since OpenInventor is used not only via SoQt now, but also
       directly;

       it that way;
  <li> Parts of the new architecture implementation have been included in
       the release.
