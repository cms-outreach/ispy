/** Split the string @a s into fields separated by matches of @a sep.

    If @a flags is the default zero, all fields matter.  If @a flags
    has #TrimEmpty set, empty fields, that is leading, trailing or two
    adjacent separators, are ignored.  Leading empty fields are kept
    with #KeepLeadingEmpty set; #KeepTrailingEmpty similarly retains
    trailing empty fields.  If all three are set, leading and trailing
    empty fields are kept, but empty fields between non-empty ones are
    ignored.  Fields are always counted and trimmed as specified by @a
    flags.

    If @a nmax is the default zero, all fields are returned.  If it is
    greater than zero, @a s is considered to have at most that many
    fields, counting left to right up to @a nmax.  If the original
    string contains more than @a nmax fields (let's say N), the last
    reported field runs from the beginning of field[@a nmax-1] to the
    end of field[N-1] including intervening separators; extra fields
    and intervening separators as well as separators at the end are
    concatenated to the last reported field.

    @a first and @a last can be used to further restrict the fields
    returned.  With the default zero values all fields are accepted.
    Non-zero @a first indicates that fields from that count onwards
    are to be included in the result.  Non-zero @a last indicates that
    only fields upto and including @a last should be included in the
    result.  Both @a first and @a last count fields from one.  Values
    greater than (non-zero) @a nmax are legitimate and are interpreted
    to mean that the last field, handled as described above, contains
    subfields separated by the separator and the selected range is to
    be returned as a single string (fields up to but not including @a
    nmax are still returned as separate strings).

    (FIXME: Negative nmax, first, last.)

    The argument combination (@a nmax == 3, @a first == 1, @a last ==
    2) means that at most three fields will be split: two normal ones
    and all the rest.  Only the first two are returned.  The function
    returns immediately after finding them, it will not consider the
    rest of the string.

    The argument combination (@a nmax == 1, @a first == 2, @a last ==
    3, @a flags == #TrimEmpty) means that leading separators are
    trimmed.  If a non-empty field follows, it is discarded, as well
    as any empty fields following it.  If two more non-empty fields
    are found, they are returned as one string, including any
    intervening separators, even if there are empty fields.

    The argument combination (@a nmax == 1, @a flags == #TrimEmpty)
    means that the leading and trailing separators are trimmed and the
    rest is returned as a single field.  Intermediate separators, even
    if they separate empty fields, are returned untouched.

    The argument combination (@a nmax == 1, @a flags == #TrimEmpty |
    #KeepTrailingEmpty) means that only the leading separators are
    trimmed and the rest is returned as a single field.  Once the
    non-empty field is found, the rest of the string is passed
    untouched, without searching it at all.

/** Replace regular expression result @a matches in template @a
    pattern.  Use @a s as the string that was originally searched by
    the regular expression and produced @a matches.

    The @a pattern is searched for instances of "\DDD" where "D" is a
    decimal digit.  More specifically the pattern is searched for a
    backslash followed by a decimal digit.  When one is found, up to
    three decimal digits are taken as a regular expression capture
    reference.  The capture reference is replaced by the corresponding
    match section from @a s as recorded in @a matches.

    If a capture reference is larger than the number of matches in @a
    matches, the reference is left intact.  The zeroeth capture bounds
    the whole string matched by the regular expression.

    The pattern "A \1 was \2" will have the "\1" replaced by what ever
    was matched in @a s by the first capturing subpattern, and "\2"
    will be replaced similary the contents of the second capturing
    subpattern.  If @a matches has only one match, the second
    replacement will not occur.

    For example, "A \00010" will become "A " followed by the entire
    string matched by the regular expression (@c matches.match(0)),
    followed by "10".

    Returns the @a pattern string with the replacements done.  */
