    replaced with the formatted value.  If no more references are left

    result in further argument references.

    The %-characters in the format pattern cannot be escaped and the
    interpretation of the digits following it cannot be stopped.  Both
    situations are easily handled with an extra replacement pattern:
    StringFormat("%1%2").arg(10).arg('%') produces "10%" and
