### RPM lcg SCRAM V0_20_0
## INITENV +PATH PATH %instroot/bin

# This package is somewhat unusual compared to other packages we
# build: we install the normally versioned product "SCRAM", but also
# create the front-end "scram" wrapper and the package database.  The
# latter do not follow the standard versioning.
#
# The front-end script can be overwritten by any version *PROVIDED*
# the platform string comes first as is the default (i.e. the
# installation tree looks like <platf>/lcg/SCRAM/<version>/src).
#
# The database is only created, but never changeed.  It is made part
# of this package, but none of the files in it are included, so if
# the package is removed, the directory will left intact.  (FIXME:
# check this is really so -- should we use %dir, or the default is
# good?)
#
# The front-end wrapper and the script go at the installation root,
# not anywhere in the package tree.  They must remain modifiable.
#
# We do the install ourselves, as "Installation/install_scram" would
# do, but putting the results elsewhere and using our own scram
# wrapper instead of using the supplied one -- mainly for easier
# override of SCRAM_LOOKUPDB; the wrapper is really rather simple so
# there is no point in trying to patch it.
#
# FIXME: should we have more than one project database and link them
# together into one big one?
