2006-02-16  Shahzad Muzaffar  <Shahzad.Muzaffar@cern.ch>

	* IgCommon3DReps.h, plugin.cc: Declare and provide representation 
	multi-method for RPhi model.

	* src/BuildFile: Remove as not needed for SCRAM V1.0.1.
	* BuildFile: Define it to be plugin here.

2005-03-04  Ianna Osborne  <Ianna.Osborne@cern.ch>

	* src/BuildFile: Port to new SCRAMV1.
	* BuildFile: Port to new SCRAMV1.

2005-01-12  Shahzad Muzaffar  <Shahzad.Muzaffar@cern.ch>

	* src/plugin.cc (doUpdate Ig2DRep): Added the ref and unref to make the
	Coin warning (about calling SoGetBoundingBoxAction::apply for an
	un-reference node.

2005-01-11  Shahzad Muzaffar  <Shahzad.Muzaffar@cern.ch>

	* src/plugin.cc (doUpdate Ig2DRep): Added the results after
	adding the material.

2005-01-05  Giulio Eulisse  <giulio.eulisse@cern.ch>

	* src/plugin.cc (doUpdate Ig2DRep): leakage of temporary
	separator. Cutting is performed only if the box is not empty.
	

2004-08-17  Giulio Eulisse  <giulio.eulisse@cern.ch>

	* plugin.cc: added support for not cutting certain volumes, as
	specified in the layers.dat configuration file. 

2004-08-15  Ianna Osborne  <Ianna.Osborne@cern.ch>

	* BuildFile: Add dependencies on the lego model.
	* IgCommon3DReps.h, plugin.cc: Browse and represent lego model.

2004-05-14  Shahzad Muzaffar  <Shahzad.Muzaffar@cern.ch>

	* BuildFile: Removed the unused package. 

2004-01-14  Giulio Eulisse  <giulio.eulisse@cern.ch>

	* plugin.cc: error in evaluating the size of the bounding
	box fixed. Possible deadlock removed.  

2004-01-12  Giulio Eulisse  <giulio.eulisse@cern.ch>

	* plugin.cc: removed the hack which was necessary with old gts
	code to understand whether thinks had been cut correctly. 

2004-01-10  Lassi A. Tuura  <lat@iki.fi>

	* BuildFile: We now use IgTextModel.
	* IgCommon3DReps.h: Export text model methods.
	* plugin.cc: Add new default support for text model.  Move to
	first invalidation-based implementation.  Remove most use of
	"doRepresent" from derived twigs, always forward to "doUpdate".
	In general, twigs should now only need to override the latter.
	Some inefficiency still remains, still need to queue all updates
	and execute them in one go, removing duplicates.

2003-12-15  Giulio Eulisse  <giulio.eulisse@cern.ch>

	* plugin.cc (MMM_DEFUN_FUNC): moving and resizing the cut plane
	according to the volume it has to cut.

2003-12-12  Giulio Eulisse  <giulio.eulisse@cern.ch>

	* plugin.cc (MMM_DEFUN_FUNC): using SELF_MASK when updating the
	3DRep during the 2DRep updating. 

2003-12-05  Giulio Eulisse  <giulio.eulisse@cern.ch>

	* src/plugin.cc (MMM_DEFUN_FUNC): reverting to the old code in
	which if the result of a 2D cut operation is the cut plane, we get
	the complementary result of the cu operation. This needs to be
	fixed.

2003-12-04  Giulio Eulisse  <giulio.eulisse@cern.ch>

	* plugin.cc (MMM_DEFUN_FUNC): handling the case in which the
	cutting plane is coplanar to one of the faces of the 3d model.

	* plugin.cc (MMM_DEFUN_FUNC): removed commented debug code.

	* plugin.cc (MMM_DEFUN_FUNC): hack to fix 2d view for solids with
	wrong normals. We make sure that the bounding box for a 2d shape
	is not too big, so that we are sure that the plane is not there.

2003-12-03  Giulio Eulisse  <giulio.eulisse@cern.ch>

	* plugin.cc (preMake3DRep): now we create the parentrep
	anyway.

2003-11-28  Giulio Eulisse  <giulio.eulisse@cern.ch>

	* plugin.cc: code rearranged so that 2D view now works and updates
	correctly. This seems to break 3D view, whenever a child is
	selected but its parent not there yet. This needs to be fixed
	absolutely.
	doUpdate multi-method for 2DRep now uses the cutting plane found
	in the model.

2003-11-19  Giulio Eulisse  <giulio.eulisse@cern.ch>
	
	* plugin.cc: it uses new IgSurfaceOperation API to do the cutting
	necessary for the 2d view.

	* plugin.cc: new multimethods which create and update an Ig2DModel
	from a twig. 

	* BuildFile: added dependency on IgOpenInventor to support 2D
	view.

2003-10-28  Lassi A. Tuura  <lat@iki.fi>

	* BuildFile, IgCommon3DReps.h, plugin.cc: Add initial case for 2D
	model output; share the update between 2D and 3D.

2003-09-13  Lassi A. Tuura  <lat@iki.fi>

	* IgCommon3DReps.h, plugin.cc, config.h, BuildFile, src/BuildFile:
	Move to SEAL Foundation classes and plug-in manager.

2003-03-27  Lassi A. Tuura  <lat@iki.fi>

	* plugin.cc: Plug-in manager update.

2003-03-25 George Alverson <George.Alverson@cern.ch>

	* plugin.cc: add inclusion of config.h to pick up the WIN API

2003-03-25  Lassi A. Tuura  <lat@iki.fi>

	* plugin.cc (doUpdate): Don't use RTTI with Inventor nodes, it
	doesn't work on Windows.

2003-03-21  George Alverson <g.alverson@neu.edu>

	* plugin.cc: Add API exports.

2003-02-21  Lassi A. Tuura  <lat@iki.fi>

	* plugin.cc: Fix capability key to model, not browser.
	* BuildFile: No dependency needed on browser any more.

2003-02-21  Lassi A. Tuura  <lat@iki.fi>

	* New package to share twig 3D representation code.
