2007-03-28  Ianna Osborne <Ianna.Osborne@cern.ch>

	* BuildFile: Modify to use the CMSSW config.
	* plugin.cc: Remove.
	* xtypeinfo.cc: New xtype info definition.

2007-03-06  Ianna Osborne <Ianna.Osborne@cern.ch>

	*  config.h, xtypeinfo.h, Ig2DModel.cc, Ig2DRep.cc: Move to
	classlib.

2005-03-09  Ianna Osborne  <ianna.osborne@cern.ch>

	* BuildFile: Port to new SCRAMV1.

2004-08-17  Giulio Eulisse  <giulio.eulisse@cern.ch>

	* Ig2DModel.cc: Using seal::LOG in place of cout for debug output.
	Added the possibility not to cut some of the twigs (useful for
	events, for example).
	
2004-05-14  Shahzad Muzaffar  <Shahzad.Muzaffar@cern.ch>
	
	* Ig2DModel.cc: Removed unused includes.

2004-01-14  Giulio Eulisse  <giulio.eulisse@cern.ch>

	* Ig2DModel.cc (Ig2DModel): now using a single quad as mesh of
	triangles which do the cutting, it seems there are no advantages
	with the new cutting code to use more than that.
	
2004-01-10  Lassi A. Tuura  <lat@iki.fi>

	* Ig2DModel.cc (setCutTransform): Use new invalidation system.

2003-12-15  Giulio Eulisse  <giulio.eulisse@cern.ch>

	* Ig2DModel.cc, Ig2DModel.h: Using a quad mesh for the cutting
	plane. New methods to set the size and the position of the cutting
	plane to better match the volume it has to cut.

2003-12-05  Giulio Eulisse  <giulio.eulisse@cern.ch>

	* src/Ig2DModel.cc (Ig2DModel): the cutting plane is not perfectly
	aligned to the XY plane to try to avoid numerical issues.

2003-12-04  Giulio Eulisse  <giulio.eulisse@cern.ch>

	* src/Ig2DModel.cc (Ig2DModel): now the cutting plane is created
	by intersecting two spheres and flattening the surface of one of
	the two spheres which is inside the other. This way we get the
	tessellation with few lines of code.

	* BuildFile: Using IgOpenInventor to create the plane which does
	the cutting.

2003-11-28  Giulio Eulisse  <giulio.eulisse@cern.ch>

	* Ig2DModel.h: cutting plane is now in the model.  createFull ()
	does not propagate visibility. Debug code commented out, it should
	be removed as soon as the new code is stressed enough.

2003-11-19  Giulio Eulisse  <giulio.eulisse@cern.ch>

	* Ig2DRep.cc: added repositionChildren () method which updated the
	position of reps in the hierarchical structure when a new child is
	inserted.
	The constructor now also add an offset and a scaling operation in
	the rep's magic () node.

	* Ig2DModel.h, Ig2DModel.cc: the Ig2DModel now creates reps with a
	twig derived hierarchical structure. It is also possible to
	override such a structure by specifying the order of (some) twig
	paths in the layers.dat file. removeFirst (), removeLast (),
	getFirst () and getLast () methods added to handle twig paths.

2003-10-28  Lassi A. Tuura  <lat@iki.fi>

	* New package, like Ig3DModel but for 2D.  Derives 2D content
	from underlying 3D model.
