	* plugin.cc: Remove.
	* xtypeinfo.cc: New xtype info definition.

2007-03-07  Ianna Osborne <Ianna.Osborne@cern.ch>

	* config.h, xtypeinfo.h: Move to classlib.
	
2005-03-09  Ianna Osborne <Ianna.Osborne@cern.ch>

	* BuildFile: Port to new SCRAMV1.

2004-05-14  Shahzad Muzaffar <Shahzad.Muzaffar@cern.ch>

	* plugin.cc: Removed unused headers.

2003-10-28  Lassi A. Tuura  <lat@iki.fi>

	* Ig3DModelEvent.h: Removed.
	* BuildFile, Ig3DModel.h, Ig3DRep.h, Ig3DModel.cc, Ig3DRep.cc,
	plugin.cc: Move majority of the code to Ig3DBaseModel, leave
	only specialisations in here.

2003-09-18  Lassi A. Tuura  <lat@iki.fi>

	* BuildFile: Remove reference to TGSInventorFix, it now comes
	with the TGS Inventor tool.

2003-09-13  Lassi A. Tuura  <lat@iki.fi>

	* Ig3DModel.h, Ig3DModel.cc, Ig3DRep.cc, config.h, xtypeinfo.h:
	Move to SEAL Foundation classes.

2003-03-27  Lassi A. Tuura  <lat@iki.fi>

	* plugin.cc: Plug-in manager update.

2003-03-19  Lassi A. Tuura  <lat@iki.fi>

	* BuildFile: Clean up external refs.

2002-10-17  Lassi A. Tuura  <lat@iki.fi>

	* Ig3DRep.h, Ig3DRep.cc: Revert the change to Ig3Drep as a node.
	Introduce instead a static method "asRep" that checks if a node is
	a rep, and if so, returns a pointer to it.  Simplifies saved model
	files and allows them to be read without the reps getting on the
	way.

2002-10-16  Lassi A. Tuura  <lat@iki.fi>

	* config.h: Default Windows to DLL use.  Unify.

2002-10-15  Lassi A. Tuura  <lat@iki.fi>

	* Ig3DRep.h, Ig3DRep.cc, Ig3DModel.cc: Add Inventor include scopes
	for Windows.  Make Ig3DRep a minimal Inventor node.  TGS refuses
	to build Windows Inventor libraries with C++ RTTI, which means we
	must always use Inventor's RTTI scheme.  Yuck.

	* xtypeinfo.h: Add export as per classlib changes.

2002-08-15  Lassi A. Tuura  <lat@iki.fi>

	* Ig3DModel.h, Ig3DModel.cc: IgSession to IgState migration.

2002-07-17  Lassi A. Tuura  <lat@iki.fi>

	* Ig3DModel.h, Ig3DModel.cc (encode, decode): Make arguments
	and return values more convenient for common usage.

2002-02-20  Lassi A. Tuura  <lat@iki.fi>

	* Ig3DModel.cc (remove): Initialise search properly.

2001-11-01  Lassi A. Tuura  <lat@iki.fi>

	* Great renaming and general clean-up patch.  Move the name
	encoding code here.

2001-08-24  Lassi A. Tuura  <lat@iki.fi>

	* Ig3DRep.h, Ig3DRep.cc: Avoid waste by making the rep simply a
	separator itself, and keep only the minimum necessary structural
	code.  Allow the rep creation to link it in the proper order in
	the child list.  Label objects to simplify reading in files.
	Allow rep to have "magic" Inventor nodes in the beginning for
	things such as lights and clip planes that must not be inside a
	separator.  Add a "clear" method so that subclasses can do
	clean-up.  Add a little more documentation comments.

	* Ig3DModel.h, Ig3DModel.cc: Keep a session around and simplify
	structure: don't allow so much freedom on scene-graph structure,
	it isn't needed for now.  Always create a top-level 3DRep to
	manage the tree.  Reps are now Inventor nodes themselves, no need
	to map them or look them up anymore.  Label objects to simplify
	reading in files.  Add a little more documentation comments.

2001-07-19  Lassi A. Tuura  <lat@iki.fi>

	* BuildFile, plugin.cc: We no longer record model information, so
	stop being a plug-in.

2001-05-25  Lassi A. Tuura  <lat@iki.fi>

	* plugin.cc: The hacks are now in TGSInventorFix.
	* BuildFile: Refer to TGSInventorFix.

2001-05-10  Lassi A. Tuura  <lat@iki.fi>

	* plugin.cc: Adapt the OIV hack to Solaris.

2001-05-09  Lassi A. Tuura  <lat@iki.fi>

	* Ig3DModel.h, Ig3DModel.cc
	(Ig3DModel::Ig3DModel): Make the root always selectable.
	(Ig3DModel::lookup): Add a means for an external object to
	translate a node to a rep using our internal mapping table.

2001-04-11  Lassi A. Tuura  <lat@iki.fi>

	* Ig3DModel.h, Ig3DModel.cc: Don't manage SoNode relationships
	between reps, let them do it themselves.  Just keep track of node
	mappings and top-level reps.

	* Ig3DRep.h, Ig3DRep.cc: Manage relationships between reps myself.
	Simplify child addition and removal protocol by assuming the
	caller must have done a `remove' earlier.  Ensure the hierarchy
	relationships are not confused with Inventor node relationships;
	keep my own node as my first child and child relationship as other
	children of my inventor node.  Erase children when erased.

2001-03-30  Lassi A. Tuura  <lat@iki.fi>

	* OpenInventor-based browser model.
