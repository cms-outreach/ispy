IgOpenInventor library is a collection of HEP specific OpenInventor nodes with examples:
<br>

<ul>
<li>IgSoArrow
<br>
An arrow has a cylinder and also a conical tip. It is suitable for
representing vectors and the like.

<li>IgSoG4Box
<br>
A box is a cuboid of given half lengths dx, dy, dz. The box is
centred on the origin with sides parallel to the x/y/z axes.

<li>IgSoG4Trd
<br>
A trapezoid with the x and y dimensions varying along z
functions.

<li>IgSoJet
<br>
A Jet object defined by energy, theta, phi, thrust.

<li>IgSoXYZGrid
<br>
A grid / grids in x, y, z planes.

<li>IgBaseQueryNode
<br>
Base class for querying nodes via selection.

<li>IgSoCoordinateAxis
<br>
A coordinate axis.

<li>IgSoG4Cons
<br>
A G4Cons is, in the general case, a Phi segment of a cone, with half-length
fDz, inner and outer radii specified at -fDz and +fDz. The Phi segment is
described by a starting fSPhi angle, and the +fDPhi delta angle for the shape.
If the delta angle is >=2*M_PI, the shape is treated as continuous in Phi
<br>
Member Data:
<br>
<br>      fRmin1  inside radius at  -fDz
<br>      fRmin2  inside radius at  +fDz
<br>      fRmax1  outside radius at -fDz
<br>      fRmax2  outside radius at +fDz
<br>      fDz     half length in z
<br>
<br>      fSPhi   starting angle of the segment in radians
<br>      fDPhi   delta angle of the segment in radians

<li>IgSoG4Tubs
<br>
A tube or tube segment with curved sides parallel to
the z-axis. The tube has a specified half-length along
the z axis, about which it is centred, and a given
minimum and maximum radius. A minimum radius of 0
signifies a filled tube /cylinder. The tube segment is
specified by starting and delta
angles for phi, with 0 being the +x axis, PI/2
the +y axis. A delta angle of 2PI signifies a
complete, unsegmented tube/cylinder

<li>IgSoSimpleTrajectory
<br>
The trajectory is described by a set of 3D points which are connected together 
by line segments.

<li>IgSo3DErrorBar
<br>
3D point with error bars in 3 orthogonal directions.

<li>IgSoCrystalHit
<br>
The crystal is drawn as a trapezoid and the energy is represented by 
a 3D trapezoidal "histogram bar" extending outwards from the back face  
of the crystal a distance which is proportional to the energy.

<li>IgSoG4Trap
<br>
A G4Trap is a general trapezoid: The faces perpendicular to the z planes
are tapezia, and their centres are not necessarily on a line parallel to
the z axis.
<br>
Note that of the 11 parameters desribed below, only 9 are really
independent - a check for planarity is made in the calculation of the
equation for each plane. If the planes are not parallel, a call to
G4Exception is made.
<br>
<br>      pDz     Half-length along the z-axis
<br>      pTheta  Polar angle of the line joining the centres of the faces
<br>              at -/+pDz
<br>      pPhi    Azimuthal angle of the line joing the centre of the face at
<br>              -pDz to the centre of the face at +pDz
<br>      pDy1     Half-length along y of the face at -pDz
<br>      pDx1    Half-length along x of the side at y=-pDy1 of the face at -pDz
<br>      pDx2    Half-length along x of the side at y=+pDy1 of the face at -pDz
<br>      pAlp1   Angle with respect to the y axis from the centre of the side
<br>              at y=-pDy1 to the centre at y=+pDy1 of the face at -pDz
<br>
<br>      pDy2     Half-length along y of the face at +pDz
<br>      pDx3    Half-length along x of the side at y=-pDy2 of the face at +pDz
<br>      pDx4    Half-length along x of the side at y=+pDy2 of the face at +pDz
<br>      pAlp2   Angle with respect to the y axis from the centre of the side
<br>              at y=-pDy2 to the centre at y=+pDy2 of the face at +pDz

<li>IgSoHitsKit
<br>
Provides a minimal object to represent a series of points
in space.

<li>IgSoSphereHit
<br>
Draws SoSphere at arbitrary location with
arbitrary scale and printout when picked.
