/*!	\class IgSoG4Trap IgSoG4Trap.h
 *
 *  \brief: The documentation from Geant says:
 * A G4Trap is a general trapezoid: The faces perpendicular to the z planes
 * are tapezia, and their centres are not necessarily on a line parallel to
 * the z axis.
 *
 * Note that of the 11 parameters desribed below, only 9 are really
 * independent - a check for planarity is made in the calculation of the
 * equation for each plane. If the planes are not parallel, a call to
 * G4Exception is made.
 *
 *      pDz     Half-length along the z-axis
 *      pTheta  Polar angle of the line joining the centres of the faces
 *              at -/+pDz
 *      pPhi    Azimuthal angle of the line joing the centre of the face at
 *              -pDz to the centre of the face at +pDz
 *      pDy1    Half-length along y of the face at -pDz
 *      pDx1    Half-length along x of the side at y=-pDy1 of the face at -pDz
 *      pDx2    Half-length along x of the side at y=+pDy1 of the face at -pDz
 *      pAlp1   Angle with respect to the y axis from the centre of the side
 *              at y=-pDy1 to the centre at y=+pDy1 of the face at -pDz
 *
 *      pDy2    Half-length along y of the face at +pDz
 *      pDx3    Half-length along x of the side at y=-pDy2 of the face at +pDz
 *      pDx4    Half-length along x of the side at y=+pDy2 of the face at +pDz
 *      pAlp2   Angle with respect to the y axis from the centre of the side
 *              at y=-pDy2 to the centre at y=+pDy2 of the face at +pDz
