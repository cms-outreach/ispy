Subject: [PATCH] features/collections-always-in-storage

Removes the ability to create standalone collections.

* Initially IgCollection could have been created standalone and 
  later be attached at some IgDataStorage. This is now prohibeted
  by design since it would complicate things too much in the case
  of associations and multiple datastorages.
